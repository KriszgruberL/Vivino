### 👀 Classes Overview

#### **main.py**
The entry point of the application. It orchestrates the execution of various data processing scripts that query the database and generate CSV files.

**Functions:**
- `main()`: Connects to the database, runs a series of query functions to generate CSV reports, and then closes the database connection. The specific queries executed include:
  - `query_limited_budget(cursor)`: Prioritizes marketing efforts by country based on user counts and wine ratings.
  - `query_highlight_wine(cursor)`: Identifies top wines to highlight for increased sales.
  - `query_top_wineries(cursor)`: Lists the best wineries based on wine ratings.
  - `query_favorites_taste(cursor)`: Finds wines that match specific taste profiles.
  - `query_common_grapes(cursor)`: Determines the most common grape varieties and their top-rated wines.
  - `query_wine_by_taste(cursor)`: Retrieves top wines based on taste characteristics.
  - `query_best_vintage_and_wine_per_country(cursor)`: Generates a leaderboard for countries based on wine and vintage ratings.


---
#### **utils/**
Contains utility scripts for querying the database, processing data, and generating CSV files.

- **connect_db.py**:
  - `connect_to_db() -> tuple[sqlite3.Connection, sqlite3.Cursor]`: Establishes a connection to the SQLite database and returns both the connection and the cursor.
  - `close_db(connexion: sqlite3.Connection) -> None`: Closes the provided database connection.

- **carbernet_per_rating.py**:
  - `query_cabernet_by_rating(cursor: sqlite3.Cursor) -> None`: Retrieves data about Cabernet Sauvignon wines, focusing on their ratings, and saves the results to a CSV file.

- **wines_by_taste.py**:
  - `query_wine_by_taste(cursor: sqlite3.Cursor) -> None`: Extracts information about top-rated wines along with their taste characteristics and writes it to a CSV file.

- **limited_budget.py**:
  - `query_limited_budget(cursor: sqlite3.Cursor) -> None`: Identifies which country should be prioritized for marketing based on user counts and wine ratings, saving the findings to a CSV file.

- **highlight_wines.py**:
  - `query_highlight_wine(cursor: sqlite3.Cursor) -> None`: Highlights the top wines to promote, based on ratings and user counts, and outputs the data to a CSV file.

- **best_wineries.py**:
  - `query_top_wineries(cursor: sqlite3.Cursor) -> None`: Compiles a list of top wineries based on the average ratings of their wines and stores the results in a CSV file.

- **country_leaderboard.py**:
  - `query_best_vintage_and_wine_per_country(cursor: sqlite3.Cursor) -> None`: Creates a leaderboard for countries based on average vintage and wine ratings, exporting the data to CSV files.

- **best_wines_per_grape.py**:
  - `query_common_grapes(cursor: sqlite3.Cursor) -> None`: Identifies the most common grape varieties globally and lists the top-rated wines for each, saving the data to a CSV file.

- **favorites_taste.py**:
  - `query_favorites_taste(cursor: sqlite3.Cursor) -> None`: Finds wines that match specific taste profiles confirmed by user feedback and saves the results to a CSV file.
